Naming Convention:
	Any variable or function name should be camelCase (first word with small letter and the other words with capital letters)
	e.g. daysToFinish, processInput()...
	Any Class or structure or enum type name should be PascalCase first letters from every word capital
	e.g. PriorityQueue, SimulationManager...
	Any constant or enum constant should be all capital letters separated by '_'
	e.g. PI = 3.14, enum ProcessState { OK, FAIL, FILE_NOT_EXIST }
	name the file as the name of the class it contains so if you build a class name PriorityQueue then the file name is PriorityQueue.h
